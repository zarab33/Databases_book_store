# {{Book_store}} Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe

## 1. Design and create the Table

```
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "public"."books";
-- This script only contains the table creation statements and does not fully represent the table in the database. It's still missing: indices, triggers. Do not use it as a backup.

-- Sequence and defined type
CREATE SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS books_id_seq;

-- Table Definition
CREATE TABLE "public"."books" (
    "id" SERIAL,
    "title" text,
    "author_name" text,
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

INSERT INTO "public"."books" ("id", "title", "author_name") VALUES
(1, 'Nineteen Eighty-Four', 'George Orwell'),
(2, 'Mrs Dalloway', 'Virginia Woolf'),
(3, 'Emma', 'Jane Austen'),
(4, 'Dracula', 'Bram Stoker'),
(5, 'The Age of Innocence', 'Edith Wharton');

```

## 2. Create Test SQL seeds

Your tests will depend on data stored in PostgreSQL to run.

If seed data is provided (or you already created it), you can skip this step.

````sql
- EXAMPLE
-- (file: spec/seeds_{table_name}.sql)

-- Write your SQL seed here.

-- First, you'd need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
-- so we can start with a fresh state.
-- (RESTART IDENTITY resets the primary key)

TRUNCATE TABLE books RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.

INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Nineteen Eighty-Four', 'George Orwell');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Mrs Dalloway', 'Virginia Woolf');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Emma', ' Jane Austen');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Dracula', 'Bram Stoker');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('The Age of Innocence', 'Edith Wharton');
```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 your_database_name < seeds_{table_name}.sql
````

## 3. Define the class names

Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by `Repository` for the Repository class name.

```ruby

# Table name: books

# Model class
# (in lib/books.rb)
class Books
end

# Repository class
# (in lib/books_repository.rb)
class BooksRepository
end
```

## 4. Implement the Model class

Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: books

# Model class
# (in lib/books.rb)

class Books

  # Replace the attributes by your own columns.
  attr_accessor :id, :title, :author_name
end

# The keyword attr_accessor is a special Ruby feature
# which allows us to set and get attributes on an object,
# here's an example:
#
# books = Books.new
# books.title = 'Dracula'
# books.autor_name = 'bram stoker'
```

_You may choose to test-drive this class, but unless it contains any more logic than the example above, it is probably not needed._

## 5. Define the Repository Class interface

Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you'd like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: books

# Repository class
# (in lib/books_repository.rb)

class BooksRepository

  # Selecting all records
  # No arguments
  def all
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, title, author_name FROM books;

    # Returns an array of Book objects.
  end

```

## 6. Write Test Examples

Write Ruby code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as RSpec tests.

```ruby
# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all books

repo = BookRepository.new

books = repo.all

books.length # =>  5

books[0].id # =>  1
books[0].title # =>  'Nineteen Eighty-Fourla'
books[0].author_name # =>  'George Orwell'

books[1].id # =>  2
books[1].name # =>  'Mrs Dalloway'
students[1].author_name # =>  'Virginia Woolf'


```

Encode this example as a test.

## 7. Reload the SQL seeds before each test run

Running the SQL code present in the seed file will empty the table and re-insert the seed data.

This is so you get a fresh table contents every time you run the test suite.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# file: spec/book_repository_spec.rb

def reset_students_table
  seed_sql = File.read('spec/seeds_students.sql')
  connection = PG.connect({ host: '127.0.0.1', dbname: 'students' })
  connection.exec(seed_sql)
end

describe StudentRepository do
  before(:each) do
    reset_students_table
  end

  # (your tests will go here).
end
```

## 8. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
